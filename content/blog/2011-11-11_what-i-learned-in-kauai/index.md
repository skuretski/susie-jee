My week trip to Kaua'i was great and relaxing. Also while there, I wanted to gain a sense of clarity. And what a perfect place to do so! So, here are the following things I concluded while in Hawai'i:
<ul>
	<li>Happiness takes work. If you don't want to work for it, then you can't complain about it.</li>
	<li>It's ok to let things slide.</li>
	<li>People are who they are. We must make an effort to accept, tolerate, and respect one another. It is not only human decency, but it is also the way of God.</li>
	<li>It is offensive to me to say, "You're a pretty girl. How come you're not married?" WTF does that mean? Those two should NOT correlate. (Include disgruntled Korean face)</li>
	<li>Financial and emotional independence takes work, but well-worth it.</li>
	<li>High standards are a necessity.</li>
	<li>Shingles are tingly, and nine hours of travel with shingles is super annoying.</li>
	<li>I hate centipedes.</li>
	<li>Nursing is trending toward a profession of past glory.Â  The regulating bodies are killing nursing slowly with every single by-law, regulation, "best-practice," mandate, and audit.</li>
	<li>Nurses are chaplains, waitresses (or waiters), punching bags, spit ball catchers, go-phers, secretaries, body builders, Starbucks stockholders, and soldiers in the trenches of war.</li>
	<li>It takes a very special person to be a great and compassionate bedside nurse.</li>
	<li>It is imperative to wellness to take a break, catch your breath, and enjoy life.</li>
	<li>It's okay to change careers.</li>
	<li>Software engineering is looking more appealing each day.</li>
	<li>Life can be scary, but in the end, we will make it out okay.</li>
	<li>I should get a book on C++</li>
</ul>
Questions that are still pending...
<ul>
	<li>Why do I still live in the Midwest?</li>
	<li>Was I really born in Korea? I think it was Hawai'i....</li>
	<li>Why didn't Obama stay in Hawai'i? It's a great state!</li>
</ul>
