This coming Saturday I'm getting married! We got engaged in May 2018. We originally planned a destination wedding in Jamaica in April 2020. 
Why April of 2020? We wanted to bypass hurricane season, but early 2019 was not enough time to gather the funds, so April 2020 was the plan. 


Fast forward to January 2019. Andrew was in the midst of Northwestern's coding boot camp, and then not-so-unexpectedly lost his job because 
construction work slowed down. While we were slightly derailed by this, we were anticipating him making a career switch anyway. His ex-employer just 
made it much sooner than we thought. Perhaps this was a blessing in disguise. Of course, with a job loss you lose insurance coverage (because 
'Merica).


Not only did we want Andrew to have health insurance, I also want to start graduate school for computer science in the fall. 
Side note: I was accepted to UIUC's master's program :) So we started talking about just getting married soon. We started throwing out ideas 
like courthouse now and keeping destination wedding plans, Vegas with family over a weekend, or small wedding. 


We decided on small wedding. This Saturday we are having a very small wedding in Lake Geneva. While it's not what we originally planned, 
we're loving everything about our small wedding. It's glamorous with old-world charm. It's small where we can have conversations with 
all attendees. We could book our dream vendors easily since it's off-season. It's not completely bank breaking. 

I feel quite proud of us. We managed to book and schedule all the wedding things in less than 2 months. That's right. <strong>We planned a 
whole wedding in less than 2 months.</strong> Because of the short time, we did miss some things. Andrew and I are not having 
bachelor/bachelorette parties. There were no showers. We could not do any pretty printed items, like invitations or ceremony programs. 


Despite this, we are so thankful for this ride. It was a great team effort. <strong>Plus, we don't have another whole year of wedding planning.</strong> 
We can concentrate on being us and on our future. I'm so excited to start this next chapter in our lives.
