Since some of my posts lately have had a negative undertone, which I am not entirely fond of, I am writing an uplifting one. It is the holiday season, a time of giving, peace, and love. As I listen to Christmas carols, it warms me. I know it's kinda corny, but it's true. If you don't have a sense of the holiday spirit at all in the month of December, you <em>might</em> want to evaluate things and get that stick out of your ass. Even if you're not Christian, I think people generally have a more cheery spirit. Just my opinion and observations. I also think the month of December is a good time to look back at the past year and reflect a bit too.

I listened to "Silent Night" and thought of all my patients and families throughout the year. And yes, it did bring tears to my eyes. I have to admit that this year has been pretty strenuous mentally and physically at work. Patient acuity has surpassed my expectations. Naturally, in my line of work, I have had a good number of people die. It's the natural order of life, and it happens. But it is life-touching as you're there day in and out, supporting patients and families. So for this holiday season, I thank my patients and families for giving me these experiences that humble me, and I thank God for the loves in my life. When I say loves in my life, I mean God, family, friends, opportunities, and hardships. By hardships, I mean the obstacles that test our resolve and faith. An easy life would make a boring shell of a person, so I thank God for those obstacles, no matter how much I curse at them. Easy is no fun. Amirite? So thank you people I've cared for for humbling me. This post has no intention to bring sorrow, but it is to thank everyone I've met at work for showing me the value of life and the gift it gives us.

For this holiday season, as we furiously rush to get everything done for perfection, let's take a breath, appreciate what we have, and give warmth and love.

James 1:17 "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights."
