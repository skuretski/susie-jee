I named this blog “A Lady with a Lamp.” Florence Nightingale, a pioneer for the profession of nursing, was nicknamed “The Lady with the Lamp.” I, of course, am no Florence Nightingale by any means; she was extraordinary for her time. She could claim “<strong>THE</strong> Lady with <strong>THE</strong> Lamp” title; she was a gentle and fiery blaze, the comfort to many. I am just <em>a</em> lady with <em>a</em> small lantern, lighting my own way and hoping to give warmth to others along the way.

My intention for this blog is to write weekly about my experiences in the hospital. Often times, they will originate in nursing, but may spill over and explore other areas as my mind wanders frequently.

This is my first post, so consider this the ignition to a thoughtful, reflective, and evolving blog.
