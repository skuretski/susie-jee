"Oh baby don't hurt me"...ha just kidding. But who doesn't like that song? Anyway, with Valentine's Day coming, I was thinking about love. I'm not the biggest fan of Valentine's Day, but I'm not the Valentine's Day Grinch either. But I figured I tossed the word "love" around a lot in this blog. And it is part of our everyday lives whether we realize it or not, whether we take it for granted or not. One of my favorite "chick flick" movies (and believe me there aren't that many) is <em>Love Actually</em>. This movie captures different forms of love, not just the romantic love people tend to think of first. If you look at your life and the people in it, think of the different types of love you experience. The love between you and your grandparents, parents, siblings, significant others, extended family, and friends are all different shapes of love, but the origin remains true. And I wanted to dissect the origin of that. Love may seem simple, but such a thing, emotion, and action is far from simple. And it causes us to do some outrageous things and makes us human.

###<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Origin of Love</span>

How does love start? <em>It starts when someone wants to put forth the effort to ensure someone else's well-being without motive.</em> Think of your parents. The bond between you and your parents, or parent figures, are probably the first love relationship you will encounter (given a non-tragic childhood). They want to ensure that you will be healthy, productive, and successful. In turn, you as a child love your parents for putting forth said effort in your life. As children get older and are less reliant, the relationship can become a more balanced relationship of giving and receiving. I will not say when this will happen because we all know children can be "children" forever. Poor parents haha.

Any type of love starts from a desire to better someone's life without the expectation of something in return.

So from my stated origin, there comes different types of love. I'll just touch on what I perceive as the most significant ones.

###<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Greatest Love of All</span>

The greatest love of all....I don't mess around. When I think of this, I think of a quote from <em>Good Will Hunting</em>. Again, a movie reference. I'm not a huge movie goer, but I think this line is perfect in describing the greatest love of all. "Real loss is only possible when you love something more than you love yourself." I would like to interject loss with love. But I suppose my point is made. The greatest love of all is when you love something more than yourself. Prime example: Jesus. Whether you are a Christian, atheist, Jew, Arab, Buddhist, etc., you cannot deny that the story of Jesus is the greatest love of all. You can believe that Jesus is not real, but the story of Jesus in the Bible is an unparalleled example of "the greatest love of all." Ultimate sacrifice and unselfishness.  Now, does this type of love exist in current times? Of course it does. Does it exist in all married couples? No, definitely not all. Does it exist among other relationships? Of course. The greatest love of all is not exclusive. But I think the greatest love of all is incredibly rare. This is the hardest love to find on earth; hence, the hefty title.

###<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Uncommon Special Love</span>

This type of love is one that I hope most people will encounter at some point in their life, and may or may not be continual. It's that special bond between two people that encompasses caring, faith, dedication, and respect. This type generally is reserved for significant others, close family and friends. It runs deep and is true. Complete self-sacrifice? Maybe not entirely, but there definitely are some significant sacrifices made. I don't mean to make sacrifice sound daunting either. Sacrifices for another should come out of a desire rather than guilt. Uncommon special love makes us human and gives us more fulfilled lives.

###<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Kind and Patient Love</span>

Yes, 1 Corinthians 13:4. I know it's used A LOT but for good reason. This type is generally reserved for family (we need patience right?) and friends. They may not be the closest people in your lives and may not be your top priority all the time, but when push comes to shove, you're there for them and vice versa. Also, a long lost friend comes to mind. You hold them dear in your heart, but different paths in life make it difficult to maintain an uncommon special love. You cherish the time you do have together, but it's hard to make it a priority all the time. After all, we're human and can't have extremely special relationships with everyone.

###<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The "I love sushi" love</span>

Yes, I'll include this ridiculousness. We often use love as a verb to show how much we really like something. And yes, sushi is amazingly good. But it's sad to say that as much as I prioritize sushi, it will never reciprocate the same feelings. It will only temporarily fill an unfulfillable void (my stomach). So this is a pseudo-love sushi. I'm sorry.

So this is my take on love. I witness and experience love everyday. At the bedside, I usually see the heart wrenching side of love. It's saddening, but it also exemplifies that bond greatly. We experience it everyday whether we realize it or not. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
