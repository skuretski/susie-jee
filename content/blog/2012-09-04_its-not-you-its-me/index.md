I think most people have realized that I'm not staying in nursing forever. It's not that I hate it. Although sometimes, I do just want to pound my head against a wall, and I feel like nursing and I are in a volatile relationship. We met and it was lustful; the future seemed bright, the world was ours. As time went on, we learned from each other and grew into comfort. We coexisted peacefully. However, as stressful events occurred, we acknowledged each other, but did not discuss it wholeheartedly. We kept the breadth on the inside, only discussing empirical things. As I've grown, my spectrum has changed; and now you seem to have a shadow cast over you. We've reached a crossroads. While remembering the happier times, we also see how much we've changed in that time. Some could say for the better, some could say for the worse. What happened? Why the change of heart?

Well, I have some words for you nursing. Don't take these words lightly.

You break my heart. You mend my heart. You restore my faith in my fellow man. You make me witness the fall of men.

Why put me in a position to change the impossible, the hopeless? Why make me feel like a failure? My humanity can only bear so much burden. I love so much it hurts.

When did you become so bureaucratic and political? You lost the essence of caring wholesomely. Do you even know what holistic means? Mind, body and soul.

You have become someone unfamiliar. Were you like that from the start and I was clouded by my naivety?

I can sense the potential, but you are held back by the shackles of bureaucrats. The lashings continue and you make a feeble fight. I cannot witness it. It's like trying to extinguish fire with oil.

At this point, nursing I must walk away from you. I know other relationships may be similarly political and volatile, but hopefully they will not involve direct life and death of others, so many casualties. I must take a leap of faith. And I'm sorry I cannot be stronger to bear and change these hardships with you. The shadow cast over you is too dark for me. Maybe one day I can come back with strength, and we can coexist peacefully. Until then, God speed to the both of us. I must seek brighter times. It's not you, it's me.
