I published <a href="https://www.susiejee.com/2017-11-08_career-change-part-1-of-unknown/" target="_blank">Career Change (Part 1 of Unknown)</a> on November 8, 2017. It has been about a year and a half since I wrote that, and almost two years since I began my career as a software engineer. What can I say so far? 


## What I've Learned


I have learned A LOT about web development, database querying and structure, and overall just thinking like an engineer in terms of code, scalability, and usability.
